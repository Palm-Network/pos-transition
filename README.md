# Palm Network is transitioning to Proof-of-Stake

The Palm Foundation recently [set out its vision for Palm network](https://medium.com/@palmfdn/palm-foundation-chooses-polygon-technology-for-zkl2-upgrade-empowering-creators-sports-640a1bbd3e1f), setting it on a multi-step journey to becoming a zkEVM L2 blockchain using Polygon technology. For most network users, the transitions outlined below will be seamless, however developers need to be aware that a few changes to how the network operates and the node software may require their code to be tested & updated to ensure continued error-free operation.

The first step is migration to Proof of Stake using Polygon Edge as the client replacing Hyperledger Besu. This repo is being used to track issues and be the community hub for Palm network contributors & developers to ask questions and obtain support during the transition.

[The official Palm Network Documentation has been updated](https://docs.palm.io/network-update) with full information on the transition - this covers information that developers, validators and node operators will require to get ready for transition & set up their own infrastructure:

- **Transition runbook**: what's happening & when
- **Testing**: what you need to do to ensure your application carries on working
- **JSON-RPC API changes**: find out what API methods are changing
- **Validators**: get started as a validator on the Proof of Stake network
- **Self-hosted nodes**: changes required for those self-hosting RPC API nodes
- **Developer updates**: changes required & testing requirements


## Testing & issue tracker

[Please create an issue here](https://github.com/Palm-Network/pos-transition/issues/new/choose) if you have any issues with testing, the shadowfork RPC nodes, or getting your own node set up.
